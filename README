The class creates a tensor with the given data and shape.

Data and shape should be input as lists, and if not, the class will return a message indicating the error.

Data and shape inputs are given as lists of numbers. Data can be any number (int or float), but shape needs to be a list of positive integers.

Data and shape inputs can be lists of any length.

The class will create a tensor with the data and shape lists, and will trim the data if there are too many input data, or fill the tensor with zeros if there isn't enough data.
